1. Tutorial that I choose for #3 is Fractal by Catlike coding
The url is http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/constructing-a-fractal/

2. I played around with Fractal. Stuff that I changed is adding a random max twist 
which rotates the game object. I also changed direction everytime the frame is updated.
